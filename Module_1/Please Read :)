#  Hi team, Apologies for the confusion. I created branches instead of folders. Will reupload my Module 0 and Module 1 exercises to avoid confusion and for cleanliness of work. 
#  My past exercises are still in the branches and you can check the timestamp of uploading.

#  For the web scraper exercise, I accidentally uploaded the blank exercise. To correct it, I deleted the file and reuploaded the new one.
